## silenced pep8 warnings
# W293: empty line has whitespace. I need that for code folding.
# W291: trailing spaces. I donâ€™t mind them.
# E261: less than 2 spaces between code and comment. I disagree (due to highlighting).
# E226: whitespace around operators. Sometimes these reduce readability in long equations.
# E228: whitespace around modulo operator: Misfires on string formatting.
# E231: whitespace after ,. In 2D array access that can hurt readability.
# E501: long lines over 79 chars are nasty, but sometimes they improve readability.
# E303: too many blank lines (>= 3 before function). I might want to use these.
# E251: no spaces around = in function call keywords. I like them.
# E401: multiple imports on one line. That actually improves readability.
# E271: multiple spaces after keywords are *necessary* for
# bracket-continued if's to avoid E125 (same indentation as body of
# the if block). And E125 really creates readability problems, while
# E271 is purely cosmetic. 
# This allows this:
# if     (foo and
#         bar):
#     baz
# Only Alternative I see: 
# if (
#         foo and
#         bar):
#     baz
# 
# E241: multiple spaces after comma can be necessary to vertically align arguments of different length.

# the sed-calls make flymake show calls as warnings instead of errors:
# F841: validation assigned but not used.
# F401: unused import.
# C901: Function too complex.
# E302: No 2 blank lines before function definition. This is only stylistic.
# W*: anything pep8 marks as warning.

# --max-complexity 9 actually allows a maximum complexity of 8
